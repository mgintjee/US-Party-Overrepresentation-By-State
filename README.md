# US Party Overrepresentation By State

My friend was telling me how both sides were the same when it came to gerrymandering and it triggered me. But rather than just get emotional with the whole dumb situation i decided to do some research. So i collected the data from the below sources and then used a pretty straight forward algorithm to determine if a party is being overrepresented given the state's party percentages.

2 possibles scenarios:
1) Include 3rd party representation (Less Realistic)
2) Exclude 3rd party representation (More Realistic)

Outcome 1:
Democrats Overrepresented in <b>13 states</b>: CA, CT, IL, MD, MA, MN, NV, NH, NJ, NY, OR, RI, WA
Republicans Overrepresented: <b>30 states</b>: 
Both Overrepresented in <b>2 states</b>: NJ, NY
